# UI Flow YAML Explanation

The `ui_flow.yaml` file defines how the automation tool navigates through game menus. Here's a brief explanation of its structure:

## Core Components

1. **States**: Defines each UI screen or menu
   ```yaml
   states:
     main_menu:
       description: "Main menu screen"
       required_elements:
         - type: "button"
           text: "Start"
   ```
   Each state includes the UI elements that must be present to identify it (like a "Start" button for the main menu).

2. **Transitions**: Defines how to move between states
   ```yaml
   transitions:
     "main_menu->options_menu":
       action: "click"
       target:
         type: "button"
         text: "Options"
   ```
   This tells the tool: "To go from main menu to options menu, click the 'Options' button"

3. **Initial & Target States**: Where the flow starts and ends
   ```yaml
   initial_state: "main_menu"
   target_state: "exit_complete"
   ```

## Navigation Flow

The YAML defines this specific navigation path:
1. Start at `initial` state
2. Move to `main_menu`
3. Click "Options" to go to `options_menu`
4. Click "Graphics" to go to `graphics_menu`
5. Click "Benchmark" to go to `benchmark_screen`
6. Wait for `benchmark_results` to appear
7. Navigate back through menus using "Back" buttons
8. From `main_menu`, click "Exit" to reach `exit_dialog`
9. Click "Yes" to confirm exit and reach `exit_complete`

## Additional Features

- **Fallbacks**: Error recovery mechanisms if something goes wrong
  ```yaml
  fallbacks:
    general:
      action: "key"
      key: "Escape"
  ```
  
- **Timeouts**: Maximum time to spend in each state before taking recovery action

The file serves as a map that guides the tool through the game's UI, telling it what to look for and what actions to take at each step.
